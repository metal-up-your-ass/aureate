// Regression test for issue #12: warmthLowPassHzSmoothed used to be reset()
// at the *oversampled* rate (sampleRate * 4) while process() always calls
// its skip() with a host-rate sample count (identically to every other
// smoother in AureateEngine) - so its stepsToTarget countdown took 4x as
// many skip() calls to exhaust, stretching its ramp to ~4x
// smoothingTimeSeconds (~0.2s) in real time instead of the documented/
// intended 0.05s. Verified against JUCE 8.0.14's
// juce::SmoothedValue::reset()/skip() (juce_SmoothedValue.h), which never
// reference sampleRate again after reset() - skip(N) simply decrements the
// stepsToTarget countdown by the raw N passed in.
//
// This test measures the bug's real, audible symptom rather than reaching
// into AureateEngine's private smoother: it jumps Warmth from 0% (cutoff
// pinned near 20 kHz, transparent to a high-frequency probe tone) to 100%
// (cutoff at 3 kHz, deep in the probe's stopband) and processes exactly one
// smoothingTimeSeconds' worth of host-rate samples in a single block. By
// the SmoothedValue contract (skip(N) with N == stepsToTarget lands exactly
// on the target), a correctly host-rate-clocked smoother must be fully
// converged to the 3 kHz cutoff at that point; the (buggy) oversampled-rate
// clocked version only completes 1/4 of its ramp in the same host-sample
// count, leaving the cutoff far higher (~12.4 kHz - see the class comment
// above) and the probe barely attenuated.
