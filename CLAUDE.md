# Aureate — tape / console saturation glue (mix)

Per-repo working memory for Claude Code sessions on this plugin. Part of the **Metal up your ass** symphonic-metal plugin suite (`github.com/basilica-audio`).

## What this is
Aureate is the "tape / console saturation glue (mix)" member of the suite. AU / VST3 / Standalone, JUCE 8.

## Status (v0.1.0 — M1 DSP completion + test coverage done)
Core DSP complete for v0.1.0: Wow/Flutter, Bias, Character (Tape/Console/Valve), HF/LF Trim, and Hiss added on top of the v0.1 bootstrap chain. **60 Catch2 tests green**, CI (macOS + Windows, pluginval strictness 10 + auval) green. GUI is a functional v0.1 slider/combo-box editor (custom LookAndFeel is roadmap M3). No signing yet (roadmap M4). Open work is tracked in this repo's GitHub **milestones/issues** (M1 closed; M2 presets/state next).

## DSP
Chain: input -> Wow/Flutter (modulated delay, host rate) -> Drive (0-24 dB) -> [4x oversampled: Warmth-driven gentle HF-rolloff low-pass -> Character-selected saturator (Tape tanh / Console cubic-clip / Valve exponential, asymmetry driven by Warmth+Bias combined) -> console-style tilt Tone (low/high shelf pair, +/-6 dB at +/-100%) -> HF/LF Trim (independent fixed-frequency shelves, 8 kHz/150 Hz, +/-6 dB) -> Hiss (shaped noise, linear 0-100% amount)] -> downsample -> DryWetMixer (delay-compensated) -> Output trim (-24..+24 dB, applied post-mix as a master trim, unlike Drive which only affects the wet path). Warmth (0-100%) jointly maps to the pre-clip low-pass cutoff (20 kHz -> 3 kHz, log-interpolated) and the saturator's asymmetry bias (0 -> 0.3, linear); Bias (-100..100%) adds an independent +/-0.3 bias contribution on top, combined bias clamped to +/-0.9. Latency is the 4x half-band polyphase IIR oversampler's reported latency (useIntegerLatency=true) **plus** Wow/Flutter's fixed base delay (6 ms, rounded to an exact integer sample count at prepare() time so it never depends on the live Wow/Flutter amount) - reported via setLatencySamples and compensated on the dry path via DryWetMixer::setWetLatency, primed before reset() per the documented JUCE 8.0.14 DryWetMixer gotcha (own regression tests in DryWetMixerContractTests.cpp). DryWetMixer's internal delay-line capacity is 8192 samples (not 1024) to stay above the worst-case total latency at 192 kHz now that Wow/Flutter's base delay is part of getLatencySamples(). Full parameter reference and musical rationale: `docs/manual.md`.

## Build & test
```sh
export CPM_SOURCE_CACHE="$HOME/.cache/CPM"      # shared JUCE 8.0.14 + Catch2 cache
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build --target Tests Aureate_Standalone --parallel 4
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```
Release/universal + pluginval + auval run in CI, not locally.

## Conventions & guardrails
- JUCE 8.0.14 via CPM · C++20 · AGPLv3 · Pamplejuce `SharedCode` pattern · manufacturer `Yvsv`, plugin code `Aurt`, `com.yvesvogl.aureate`.
- **Real-time safety:** no alloc/lock/file-IO/logging on the audio thread; allocate in `prepareToPlay`; `reset()` clears all state; `ScopedNoDenormals`; smoothed params; report latency via `setLatencySamples` where the chain adds any.
- **DryWetMixer gotcha (JUCE 8.0.14):** prime `setWetMixProportion(mix)` before `reset()` in `prepare()` (else it ramps from 100% wet). See sibling `overture`.
- **`main` is protected** — no direct commits; feature branch + PR, green CI required (Conventional Commits). New DSP needs tests (null/reference, NaN/Inf sweep, state round-trip, latency).

## Roadmap
GitHub milestones (M1 DSP & tests · M2 presets/state · M3 GUI & a11y · M4 release/signing/v1.0.0) + issues. Read with `gh issue list --repo basilica-audio/aureate`.
